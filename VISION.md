# Vision (draft)

This outlines the vision for Slack Chat for VS Code. The goal is to crystallize the driving ideas for the community of users and contributors. Tactically, this document will also help to prioritize feature requests and issue reports.

This document is not set in stone, and Iâ€™m happy to get issues and suggestions to improve it.

## Goal

The idea behind this extension is not to put chat inside your editor, but to make the editor the center of collaboration for engineering teams.

Since the birth of editors, editors have been built to make users productive with code. Add multi-party version control (say git) to the engineering toolkit, and you got teams writing code in their editors and managing complex projects with git.

The progress of developer and team productivity has evolved to the point where teams use multiple services in their development cycles, from project management, to continuous integration, and then to real-time bug tracking. These services have evolved to become our peers in writing high-quality code that keeps up with the need to respond quickly to the market.

Slack has shown what a unified collaboration experience could look like, with our services and our teams working in tandem. But with one gap: Slack is one-degree-too-many away from our code, and that leads to knowledge falling through the cracks. For example, I've noticed teams switching constantly between GitHub and Slack during a code review.

This extension is an experiment to help engineering teams collaborate faster.
